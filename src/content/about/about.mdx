Data Scientist and Computer Engineer by University of Granada (UGR). I learned the fundamentals of Machine Learning algorithms, how to preprocess large amounts of data and make valuable visualizations. I like the whole AI world and IoT topics. Some Kaggle Awards (kaggle.com/fnavales), and code (github.com/fnavales)

Besides computers, I have fun training powerlifting and boxing, sometimes I upload videos on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChj14Q8m3tZRbdt0J4j3MYw).

To sum it all up, I'm passionate about technology, proactive and eager to undertake new adventures.
