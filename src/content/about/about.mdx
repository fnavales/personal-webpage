Born in 1992, I grew up feeling an attraction towards technology.

After school, I started to study Network Systems Management. Then, I moved to Granada where I currently live. At the University of Granada (UGR), I studied a computer engineering degree and got an M.S. in Data Science and Computer Engineering. There, I learned the fundamentals of machine learning and how to manage and analyze large amounts of data.

Besides computers, I like to learn about how to live a healthy lifestyle (nutrition and training), and I'm also interested in minimalism and videography.

To sum it all up, I'm passionate about technology, proactive and eager to undertake new adventures.
