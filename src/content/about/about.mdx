Born in 1992, I grew up with an attraction through technology.

After school, I started to study Network Systems Management. Then, I moved to Granada where I currently live. 
At the University of Granada (UGR), I've studied a computer engineering degree and a M.S. in Data Science and Computer Engineering. 
There, I learned the fundamentals of machine learning and how to manage and analyze large amounts of data.   

Besides computers I like to learn about healthy lifestyle (nutrition and training), minimalism, photography and video.
