In this paper we propose the analysis, design and implementation of a parallel algorithm based on MapReduce to simulate marketing markets. The work focuses on analyzing Apache Spark and GraphX, a library that includes additional functionalities to deal with graphs, helping in the development of the algorithm in an efficient and scalable way. As part of this work, an experiment with different core configurations involved has been carried out to evaluate the benefits and limitations of distributed computing versus sequential computing. The obtained result suggest that applying algorithms based on MapReduce and implemented in Spark can achieve a higher efficiency compared to non-distributed implementations.
